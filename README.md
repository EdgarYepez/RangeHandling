# RangeHandling

## Description

RangeHandling is a Perl library for dealing with sequences of data structures organized by numerical stamps. Timelines or time-aligned data, like labelled or annotated media corpuses, are common instances of such sequences.

### Use case

Although not being specifically intended for it, a typical use case of this library comes when dealing with Praat's interval-tier `.TextGrid` files, as the library provides a way to parse and convert such files into the corresponding library's output objects. However, library's output objects from parsers written on demand for other interval-tier file types, such as `.mlf` or `.xra`, will work fine.
