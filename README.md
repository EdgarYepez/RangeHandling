# RangeHandling

RangeHandling is a Perl library for handling sequences of labels or data structures sorted by numerical stamps that represent ranges. It can be used as a tool for dealing with Praat's Interval-Tier TextGrid files.

## Description

It represents internally a data structure formed by objects called `Range`, `Node` and `Chain`. In essence, a `Chain` object contains a collection of `Node` objects. A `Node` object contains a `Range` object and stores a value (either a `HASH` reference, an `ARRAY` reference or a `SCALAR`). A `Range` object represents numerical stamps. Additionally, the library provides a way for reading and editing Praat's Interval-Tier TextGrid files. Such functionality is implemented by using `TextGrid` objects.

## Install

By the moment, the only way to get the library is by manually downloading or cloning this repository. Once downloaded, copy the `YERangeHandling` directory either into a Perl module's directory, so that it is globally available, or into a directory in where its usage is expected.

The library was programed and tested in Perl 5, version 26, subversion 1 (v5.26.1). It is no warrantied it will work in any other Perl versions (not even in v5.26.1 :-) ).

A `cpan` link is coming soon.
